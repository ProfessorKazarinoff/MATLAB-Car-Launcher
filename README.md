# Matlab_Car_Launcher
A car launcher ran on matlab as part of a project for ENGR114 at PCC
# Problem Statement:
Our group was tasked with building a launching mechanism for model cars to roll down a ramp.  This project will be primarily used to help the ENGR101 class with their group projects of building a car that fits in a shoebox and can be released from the provided ramp.  This project will use an Arduino as well as Matlab code and 3D printed gates to release the vehicles from a preset height at a consistent speed for all participants.
# Bill of materials:

# Results:
We were successfully able to fulfill our problem statement by completing a gate that would release a car for the ENGR101 group project using the Arduino and matlab. We did this using various electronic parts as well as using 3D printed gates to hold the car until programing the gates to release.

# Future Work:
Future work for this project could be upgrading the motors being used for more speedy opening of the gate.  Also mounting multiple gates would allow for two cars to travel at once and race each other.  This could also be combined with some kind of censor that would track when the vehicle crossed a designated distance and that would allow the ENGR101 project to have a speed element as well as the total distance tracking that it currently has. Also, maybe designing the gates in a different way could potentially improve efficiency for example having them lift up instead of opening.
